# Project title: Whip!

Project description: Having a webpage that uses Google 
Maps to locate nearby restaurants as well as Pinterest 
connected to show recipes of those restaurants/dishes 
searched. The choice of dining out or cooking at home is 
up to the consumer.

User story: As a consumer, I want to find recipes from my 
local restaurants or restaurants from food/dish searches 
so that I can enjoy specific meals either dining in or out. 

Wireframe: Building a single page site that has a search 
bar using hidden sources to track things related to your 
search, including recipes, suggestions, as well as nearby 
restaurants. The idea is to be food themed but easily 
navigated. 

API’s to be used: The APIs to be used will be Google Maps 
as well as Pinterest. Both are available. 

Breakdown of tasks:
* Justin: working on recipe API and creating a TO-DO list under the “projects tab” in the Repo
* Sadiq: Frame out a story for the front end and exactly like it will look like with a drawing /rendering and that person will also do the Powerpoint and Readme.
* Tino: working on restaurant API and logo
* Leah: Manager, in charge of the repo in Github (accepting changes) and take the EXCALIDRAW and design it in Bootstrap and CSS
Our group proudly states that we will all be working on 
HTML, CSS as well as any questions that may come up. 
We would prefer to assign tasks as smaller items as we 
go rather than one entire blanket title. We are striving to 
assisting each other as well.
